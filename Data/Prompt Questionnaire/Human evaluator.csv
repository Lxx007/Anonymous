It felt really claustrophobic， more so than the shooting itself it&#39;s the steps that at some point became so loud and in every direction. I am not an FPS lover personally so that might as well be taken into consideration. It is overall a pretty straightforward first person shooter. I would not play that personally because it made a bit anxious and after the second game it gets repetitive， but I&#39;ve played worst and more boring games...all in all， at first I thought I had to clear the area to make orange fog appear， but when I realized it was present whether or not I killed all the dummies I tried to rush to end the loud noise as soon as possible.

The hitbox and hp of the dummies are a bit weird， sometimes a single shot kills them and sometimes it seems completely indestructible (maybe it&#39;s because their health doesn&#39;t get restored when I die， so if I shot them in last game they are weak). Sometimes they die of friendly fire too ahahaI&#39;d say maybe make the footsteps a bit less loud and ""softer""， and just fixing hitboxes and give some sort of variety (mb different mannequins with different abilities). I realize that not enjoying loud noises is a personal thing and usually fps lovers enjoy that.","17.Please classify the following @paragraphs into three categories based on their content related to audio cues in the game.If the paragraph doesn&#39;t clearly and directly express a positive or negative sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose A.If the paragraph clearly and directly express a negative sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose B.If the paragraph clearly and directly express a positive sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose C.If the text doesn&#39;t mention audio cues， it means there are no complaints or compliments about audio cues.

The randomness of the enemy generation is too great. I don’t know where the enemies will be produced. Sometimes there are more and sometimes less. You can only pass the level by luck. The reaction speed of the enemy is too fast， and every time the player encounters the enemy facing the player， it is too late to dodge. If this happens every time， if you are not lucky， you will not be able to pass the level.我对游戏的体验并不好。 敌代的随机性太大了。 我不知道敌人会在哪里产生。 有时多，有时少。 你只能靠运气通过关卡。 敌人的反应速度太快了，玩家每次遇到面对自己的敌人，都来不及躲闪。 如果每次都出现这种情况，运气不好的话是过不了关的。","90.Please classify the following @paragraphs into three categories based on their content related to audio cues in the game.If the paragraph doesn&#39;t clearly and directly express a positive or negative sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose A.If the paragraph clearly and directly express a negative sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose B.If the paragraph clearly and directly express a positive sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose C.If the text doesn&#39;t mention audio cues， it means there are no complaints or compliments about audio cues.

The randomness of enemy production is too large， it will become a game of luck.2. The enemy reacts too quickly. Every time the player encounters an enemy facing the player， he will be hit before he has time to avoid it. He can only pass the game by luck.3. The enemy will not be refreshed every time the player dies.4. There is no reloading action when the firearm is reloaded， and the reloading is completed in an instant， and there is no reloading time.5. There is no feedback when the bullet hits the enemy， and there is no feedback when the bullet hits the enemy.6. When the player dies， it can still be operated during the time of the death prompt; the enemy&#39;s attack does not stop when the player dies， or the enemy&#39;s attack may stop， but the sound effect is still there.7. When the enemy is attacking， there is no action performance， making it difficult for the player to judge whether the enemy is attacking.这个游戏还有很多可以优化的地方：1、敌人生产的随机性太大，会变成一个运气游戏。2、敌人反应太快，每次玩家遇到面向玩家的敌人没来得及躲避就已经被打到，只能凭运气通关游戏。3、每次玩家死亡后，敌人不会刷新。4、枪械装弹时没有填弹动作，填弹在一瞬间完成，没有填弹时间。5、子弹打到敌人没有受击反馈，敌人的子弹打到自己也没有受击反馈。6、玩家死亡时，在死亡提示的时间里仍然可以操作；敌人的攻击在玩家死亡时没有停止，也可能是敌人攻击停止了，但是音效还在。7、敌人在攻击时，没有动作表现，让玩家难以判断敌人是否在攻击。","91.Please classify the following @paragraphs into three categories based on their content related to audio cues in the game.If the paragraph doesn&#39;t clearly and directly express a positive or negative sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose A.If the paragraph clearly and directly express a negative sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose B.If the paragraph clearly and directly express a positive sentiment towards the game&#39;s audio cues， please choose C.If the text doesn&#39;t mention audio cues， it means there are no complaints or compliments about audio cues.
